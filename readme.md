# Twitter - Single User Minimum Viable Product

Thank you for visiting my beginner Twitter project. The aim of this project is to create a simple full stack application. A tweet can be entered into a database, rendered and deleted.
 

## Getting Started

Download all files and and install using standard terminal commands.
To run and inspect this application locally you will need; Any reputable browser, Node.js (8.10.0 LTS was used in development), and MongoDB (4.0 or newer).

### Prerequisites

This application uses JavaScript, Node and Mongo to implement the client, server and database requirements respectively. 


### Installing

Installation is handled with Node Package Manager. Open your terminal and ensure you are in the proper directory.Use the following commands to install.

```
npm init
```

Initializes the installation. Enter any preferences or hit the enter key to accept standard options for each field.

```
npm install
```

Will install the necessary packages.

```
node server.js
```

will initialize the program. The application is now live.

Try pressing the tweet button at the top and enter text to check functionality.
